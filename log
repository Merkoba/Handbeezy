Around the time of ff 28. The server was updated to 1.5 and ff as of 29 will only work with it and not the earlier version. Theoretically you can run your own account server but it's touch and go if you can get it to work. They're suppose to be working on that but haven't seen any real news in more than a year.

That's machine language (or the equivalent asm).
Lisp is a high level language, and you can do a heck of a lot in it with not so much code.
The people who complain about the syntax are just looking at it from the pov of an outsider that doesn't know how simple it actually is. It's a lot like Perl in that way. People see some symbols and immediately get scared or think it's complicated. But once you know the basics, it's easy to read unless someone obfuscated their code on purpose (which btw also happens with C, as demonstrated in the famous yearly competitions). This is what happens when you form your opinions of languages based on heresay, memes, and first impressions. And it's the same way with operating systems. text editors, and everything else. If you want to have an informed opinion that's worth anything, you have to do your own homework, rather than take the easy way out and let someone else's opinions rule over your mind (which is how marketing works, they tell you what to like).

That's machine language (or the equivalent asm).
Lisp is a high level language, and you can do a heck of a lot in it with not so much code.
The people who complain about the syntax are just looking at it from the pov of an outsider that doesn't know how simple it actually is. It's a lot like Perl in that way. People see some symbols and immediately get scared or think it's complicated. But once you know the basics, it's easy to read unless someone obfuscated their code on purpose (which btw also happens with C, as demonstrated in the famous yearly competitions). This is what happens when you form your opinions of languages based on heresay, memes, and first impressions. And it's the same way with operating systems. text editors, and everything else. If you want to have an informed opinion that's worth anything, you have to do your own homework, rather than take the easy way out and let someone else's opinions rule over your mind (which is how marketing works, they tell you what to like).

Around the time of ff 28. The server was updated to 1.5 and ff as of 29 will only work with it and not the earlier version. Theoretically you can run your own account server but it's touch and go if you can get it to work. They're suppose to be working on that but haven't seen any real news in more than a year.

Around the time of ff 28. The server was updated to 1.5 and ff as of 29 will only work with it and not the earlier version. Theoretically you can run your own account server but it's touch and go if you can get it to work. They're suppose to be working on that but haven't seen any real news in more than a year.

That's machine language (or the equivalent asm).
Lisp is a high level language, and you can do a heck of a lot in it with not so much code.
The people who complain about the syntax are just looking at it from the pov of an outsider that doesn't know how simple it actually is. It's a lot like Perl in that way. People see some symbols and immediately get scared or think it's complicated. But once you know the basics, it's easy to read unless someone obfuscated their code on purpose (which btw also happens with C, as demonstrated in the famous yearly competitions). This is what happens when you form your opinions of languages based on heresay, memes, and first impressions. And it's the same way with operating systems. text editors, and everything else. If you want to have an informed opinion that's worth anything, you have to do your own homework, rather than take the easy way out and let someone else's opinions rule over your mind (which is how marketing works, they tell you what to like).

That's machine language (or the equivalent asm).
Lisp is a high level language, and you can do a heck of a lot in it with not so much code.
The people who complain about the syntax are just looking at it from the pov of an outsider that doesn't know how simple it actually is. It's a lot like Perl in that way. People see some symbols and immediately get scared or think it's complicated. But once you know the basics, it's easy to read unless someone obfuscated their code on purpose (which btw also happens with C, as demonstrated in the famous yearly competitions). This is what happens when you form your opinions of languages based on heresay, memes, and first impressions. And it's the same way with operating systems. text editors, and everything else. If you want to have an informed opinion that's worth anything, you have to do your own homework, rather than take the easy way out and let someone else's opinions rule over your mind (which is how marketing works, they tell you what to like).

Around the time of ff 28. The server was updated to 1.5 and ff as of 29 will only work with it and not the earlier version. Theoretically you can run your own account server but it's touch and go if you can get it to work. They're suppose to be working on that but haven't seen any real news in more than a year.

Around the time of ff 28. The server was updated to 1.5 and ff as of 29 will only work with it and not the earlier version. Theoretically you can run your own account server but it's touch and go if you can get it to work. They're suppose to be working on that but haven't seen any real news in more than a year.

That's machine language (or the equivalent asm).
Lisp is a high level language, and you can do a heck of a lot in it with not so much code.
The people who complain about the syntax are just looking at it from the pov of an outsider that doesn't know how simple it actually is. It's a lot like Perl in that way. People see some symbols and immediately get scared or think it's complicated. But once you know the basics, it's easy to read unless someone obfuscated their code on purpose (which btw also happens with C, as demonstrated in the famous yearly competitions). This is what happens when you form your opinions of languages based on heresay, memes, and first impressions. And it's the same way with operating systems. text editors, and everything else. If you want to have an informed opinion that's worth anything, you have to do your own homework, rather than take the easy way out and let someone else's opinions rule over your mind (which is how marketing works, they tell you what to like).

People see some symbols and immediately get scared or think it's complicated. But once you know the basics, it's easy to read unless someone obfuscated their code on purpose (which btw also happens with C, as demonstrated in the famous yearly competitions). This is what happens when you form your opinions of languages based on heresay, memes, and first impressions. And it's the same way with operating systems. text editors, and everything else. If you want to have an informed opinion that's worth anything, you have to do your own homework, rather than take the easy way out and let someone else's opinions rule over your mind (which is how marketing works, they tell you what to like).

Around the time of ff 28. The server was updated to 1.5 and ff as of 29 will only work with it and not the earlier version. Theoretically you can run your own account server but it's touch and go if you can get it to work. They're suppose to be working on that but haven't seen any real news in more than a year.

>think like a computer.
That's machine language (or the equivalent asm).
Lisp is a high level language, and you can do a heck of a lot in it with not so much code.
The people who complain about the syntax are just looking at it from the pov of an outsider that doesn't know how simple it actually is. It's a lot like Perl in that way.
